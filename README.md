Codes insights from the homonymous book.

I am mostly changing the code to match ES6 syntax as much as I can...



## Quick notes and insights from the book:

- Check v8 version: `node -e "console.log(process.versions.v8)"`
- List all v8 possible options: `node --v8-options`
- Enable all available harmony features use: --harmony

- Thread discussion about large heaps in v8 - https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=847
